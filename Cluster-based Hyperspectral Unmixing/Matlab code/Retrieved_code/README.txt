MLM_unmixing.m - Implementation of MLM unmixing method

The implementation of this MATLAB function is heavily based on the demo of MLM method, whose reference is:

% Reference:
% R. Heylen, P. Scheunders, "A multilinear mixing model for nonlinear 
% spectral unmixing," IEEE Tran. Geosci. Remote Sens., vol. PP, no. 99., 
% pp. 1-12, 2015
%
% Rob Heylen, University of Antwerp, 2015

The functions model_LMM.m, model_MLM.m are part of the demo on MLM, are were left unchanged
