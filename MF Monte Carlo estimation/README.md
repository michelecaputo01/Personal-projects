# Multifidelity Monte Carlo Estimation of Variance and Sensitivity Indexes
In this folder, an innovative aproach is proposed in the context of Sensitivity Analysis. In partcular, using low-fidelity models (i.e. very similar to the base model but with different parameters in order to reduce complexity or computational costs)
