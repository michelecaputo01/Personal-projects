# Multifidelity Monte Carlo Estimation of Variance and Sensitivity Indexes
In this folder, an innovative approach is proposed in the context of Sensitivity Analysis. In particular, by using low-fidelity models (i.e., models very similar to the base model but with different parameters to reduce complexity or computational costs) combined with Monte Carlo methods, it is possible to obtain very precise estimates of the sensitivity (Sobol) indices and the model variance. This procedure is first applied to a simple sinusoidal function, called the Ishigami function, and then to the Water Borehole Model, which describes the flow of a fluid through a borehole, where the complexity is higher and the parameters are more numerous.
