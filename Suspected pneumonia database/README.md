# Suspected pneumonia database
In this folder the analysis of some pneumonia cases is reported. Data are not available according to privacy policy. 
The aim is to predict the probability of death of some patients day-by-day during their hospitalization, using their clinical data and vital parameters. After a medical-informed preprocessing, all the principal data science methods were tested in order to achive a precise output, such as ensemble methods, decision trees, linear or logistic models. All the models were fine-tuned and applied to a test dataset, assessing a good performance.
