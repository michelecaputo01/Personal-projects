# Suspected pneumonia database
In this folder, the analysis of several pneumonia cases is presented. The data are not publicly available due to privacy policies.
The aim is to predict the daily probability of death for patients during their hospitalization, using their clinical data and vital parameters. After a medical-informed preprocessing, all the main data science methods were tested to achieve precise predictions, including ensemble methods, decision trees, and linear or logistic models. All models were fine-tuned and applied to a test dataset, demonstrating good performance.
