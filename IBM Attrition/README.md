# IBM Attrition
In this folder an analysis of employee attrition at IBM is conducted. The dataset was downloaded for free from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/ibm-attrition-dataset). In particular, the aim is to accurately assign the probability of attrition to each employee based on their department, age, salary, and other factors. The analysis is carried out entirely using robust, non-parametric methods, including innovative approaches for outlier detection, variable selection, and the training of Logistic and Generalized Additive Models. In the end, a Survival Analysis is performed, highlighting the most influential variables.
